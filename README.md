# Mediphysical

For this project, I made a program called MediPhysical that will act as an at-home physical. The program user will input their personal information such as height, weight, sex, etc., and the program will output a user profile for them that has the health statistics they input, calculate new statistics from the ones provided, and recommendations based on these results.
